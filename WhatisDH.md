When it comes to digital humanities everyone seems to draw their own conclusion as to what they think it is. Some deem it as progressivism, some view it as building, we go further to say community and sharing, but what is digital humanities really ? A wise man would inform you that describing digital humanities, or DH for short would be equivalent to explaining what water taste like. To begin I will discuss some of the views of Matthew G. Kirschenbaum who wonders how it has entered our English departments. This one serves as a more immediate realization of digital humanities given that I am an English major and had the choice to take this class an option, also, most of this class has consisted of a surplus of computer work, thus digital humanities. Kirschenbaum finds it necessary to refer to wikepedia for the definition and it states “The digital humanities, also known as humanities computing, is a field of study, research, teaching, and invention concerned with the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities”. Now lets delve a little into what is meant by humanities computing; University of Chicago believes “humanities computing, is a field of study, research, teaching, and invention concerned with the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities”[@kirschenbaum2010], but also use digital humanities as a synonymic two. 

Stephen Ramsey is a tenured professor of digital humanities and believes that it is necessary to know how to “code” in digital humanities. Bluntly Ramsey states, “Personally, I think Digital Humanities is about building things. [. . .] If you are not making anything, you are not…a digital humanist,” which well conveys connotations of humanities computing, although he himself may not feel exactly the same. Coding can be described as “a form of writing with a dual audience: machines and other coders (including one’s future self)”, courtesy of digitalhumanitiesnow.org

Julia Flanders explains technology as “technological progressivism”, and The narratives that surround technology tend, understandably, to be progressive.” The fact that the power of computer chips keep getting better and faster over the years, as well as an increase in disk utility shows the advancements of technology, and this advancement and progression is what we can deem a digital humanity. “Digital humanities scholarship to a large degree shares this sense of progress”, Flanders exclaims “We see, first of all, simple infrastructural developments that change the social location of computers and bring them into our sphere of activity.” 

In conclusion digital humanities is a hard topic to dissect concisely as one, but many things amongst the digital and human world collaboratively. In relation to “what is digital humanities”, Kirschenbaum says “It’s tempting
to say that whoever asks the question has not gone looking very hard for an
Answer,” for one will realize the answer is in multiple perspectives among a similar parallel.
