 # What Is DH?
 
 ### Digital Humanities?
 When starting off, I had no idea what Digital humanities entailed. I knew there would
 some working with computers, but didn't realize how much computer work would be needed.
 I am far from a computer literate person, so, this is quite the struggle for me. When
 finding out just how many programs I needed for this class, I was confused as to why.
 I still didn't quite understand what Digital Humanities is. 
 
 ### Discovering DH
 Upon reading required texts, I finally had a definition for Digital Humanities.
 In an article by Kirschenbaum, *What Is Digital Humanities and What is it Doing in
 English Departments*, this is the definition that was given:
 > The digital humanities, also known as humanities computing, is a field of study,
research, teaching, and invention concerned with the intersection of computing and
the disciplines of the humanities.

### What Does That Mean?
For starters, you know that there is the word 'computing' in the definition, meaning 
there is involvement of computers and electronics. So, if you take the rest of the 
definition, I believe that would mean that in Digital Humanities you'll be researching 
and analyzing in electronic form. However, with the few weeks that I've had in class it 
seems to be more than that. There is a lot of technological things going on in Digital
Humanities. We've learned how to use different programs in order to make documents and
a different way of writing. Meaning Microsoft Word has been taking out of this class 
and replaced by plan text docs that are written with specific characters that will 
translate into different things when converted into different documents. After reading 
the Kirschenbaum article, I still didn't quite understand what exactly DH was. I 
understand that it's complicated, and it involves technology and research, but I still
didn't quite grasp it. 

### Coming to an Understanding
You would think that having a solid definition, and understanding that definition would
then allow you to understand the topic under consideration, it didn't. It caused me
more confusion. Until, I read another article by Mark Sample called, *The Digital 
Humanities is not About Building, It's About Sharing.* In the article Sample states, 
>The heart of the digital humanities is not the production of knowledge; it's the 
*reproduction* of knowledge
That quote solidified everything to me. Digital Humanities was about changing the way 
that knowledge is presented. It's changing the way that people think about presenting 
the knowledge that they've gathered. Three weeks ago I never would have thought I'd be 
writing in Markdown, making rtf files in pandoc, or trying to figure out how to compile
an ebook. 

### Coming to an End
Digital Humanities is about using technology to research and teach and present things 
in an electronic form. It challenges the typical way of thinking when it comes to 
technologically presenting information. There is more than just Microsoft Word out
there.
